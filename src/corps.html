            The field force is grouped into Corps. Some of these are defensively oriented and have, over the years, acquired an unofficial - 'Holding'. The others are called reserve or, unofficially again, 'Strike' Corps. The principal offensive formations of the Indian army are the three Strike Corps - 1 Corps, 2 Corps & 21 Corps. These are built around a nucleus of a single armored division and two infantry divisions - probably with more mechanized brigades than basic infantry formations. Strike corps should be capable of being inserted into operational level battle, either as battle groups or as a whole, to capture or threaten strategic and operational objective(s) with a view to cause destruction of the enemy's reserves and capture sizeable portions of territory.

           Every command generally consists of two or more corps. In total there are thirteen corps in the Indian army each of them commanded by a General Officer Commander (GOC), who is also called the Corps Commander. He holds a Lieutenant General rank. Every corps is made of three to four divisions.
